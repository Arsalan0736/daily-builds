# 🚀 Daily Full-Stack Builds

This repository is my ongoing collection of **daily full-stack development work** — practical components, backend utilities, APIs, UI layouts, and complete mini-projects.  
Each build reflects how I think, how I solve problems, and how I write clean, production-ready code.

Whether you're technical or non-technical, this repo shows one thing clearly:  
**I build consistently, I build with purpose, and I understand the full stack end-to-end.**

## 📌 What’s Inside
Every folder is a self-contained build that showcases one or more of these skills:

### **Frontend**
- Modern, responsive UI  
- Reusable components  
- Smooth user experience  
- Real-world layouts and interactions  

### **Backend**
- APIs for real business logic  
- Authentication, validation, middleware  
- Database operations and schema design  
- Secure and scalable backend structure  

### **Full-Stack Integration**
- Connecting UI to APIs  
- Handling state, routing, and data flow  
- Building features the way real products work  

Each build is small, polished, and practical.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
daily-dev-builds/
│
├── 01-[build-name]/
├── 02-[build-name]/
├── 03-[build-name]/
└── ...
```

Every build contains:
- A short README explaining the idea  
- Screenshots or API examples  
- Source code (frontend and/or backend)  
- Simple steps to run it locally  

This helps anyone — even non-technical viewers — understand what the build does.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- To showcase my full-stack capabilities through daily progress  
- To demonstrate consistency, discipline, and technical range  
- To document real, working code — not just theory  
- To help recruiters & clients understand how I approach building software  
- To build a long-term, transparent portfolio of my growth

## ▶️ Running Any Build

```
cd daily-dev-builds/[folder-name]
npm install
npm run dev
```

(If a build contains separate frontend + backend folders, each will have its own instructions.)
